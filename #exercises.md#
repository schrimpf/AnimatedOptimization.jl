# Exercises


1. Add support for equality constraints to one or more of the algorithms in `AnimatedOptimization.jl`.
2. Take your favoriate optimization problem (preferrably one that is not too easy, but also does not take more than a few minutes to solve), write code to evaluate the objective function and constraints, and then experiment with using various solvers. Either 

    1. Add your problem as a test to `AnimatedOptimization.jl` or
    2. Benchmark the performance of various solvers (Optim, Ipopt, NLopt, Knitro, JuliaSmoothOptimizers) and/or a variety of solver options.
3. Adapt one or more of the algorithms in `AnimatedOptimization.jl` to use the API and infrastructure of one of the popular Julia optimization packages 

      * The popular Julia optimization packages are: 

          * [Optim.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/Optim.jl/)

          * [JuMP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) which uses [MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl)
          * [JuliaSmoothOptimizers](https://juliasmoothoptimizers.github.io/#home) which uses [NLPModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModels.jl)

        There is no sequential quadratic programming algorithm in any of these packages, so that would be a good one to work on.
4. Implement an optimization algorithm not included in `AnimatedOptimization.jl`. Of the algorithms mentioned, but not implemented, SLSQP, Augmented Lagrangian, and CMA-ES seem the most interesting and potentially useful (as far as I know, there are no quality Julia implementations for any of them, except perhaps CMA-ES).
